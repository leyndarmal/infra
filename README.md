## Background
* This component is originally taken from a personal project, where there are multiple services that share this mutual library for the following functionality:
  - messasging functions (rabbitMQ broker)
  - redis cache memory functions
  - Random "utils" functions that I had omitted. But the idea is, that it is shared by multiple components.
